# Goose-Game
A simple 2D game implemented using the Pygame library in Python. This game was writing as part of the educative marathon to get familiar with Python.

How to Run
1.	Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.	Install the Pygame library by running pip install pygame in your terminal.
3.	Place the game images (background.png, player.png, enemy.png, bonus.png) in the same directory as the game script.
4.	Run the game script using the command python game_script.py
